# WordLadder

Word Ladder console application project.

This project intends to build a word ladder between two distinct words, of the same length.
Each step of the ladder must be a word with only one different character than the adjacent steps of the ladder.
All other characters must remain the same, and in the same position.

Ex: spin - spit - spot

Four arguments are to be given:

A path to a dictionary file
A start word
An end word
A path to a text file that will hold the solution

ie: WordLadder.exe "C:\Users\MyUserName\words-english.txt" "spin" "spot" "C:\Users\MyUserName\result.txt"
